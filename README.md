# IsabelleGym Agent System

A comprehensive agent interface system for Isabelle/HOL theorem proving with integrated support for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reinforcement learning, and training data collection.

## Overview

This system provides a unified interface for developing and deploying theorem proving agents in the IsabelleGym environment. It features multi-session support, training data collection, proof visualization, and seamless integration with various proving strategies.

## Deployment
### 1. Use install.sh
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

### 2. Use Docker Compose

docker-compose up -d

source .venv/bin/activate

If meeting "Bad component..." problem when compiling scala backend, try creating a empty main file under isabelle/Admin/components path.
## Detailed Information
### 1. Agent Interface (`gym/isabelle_agent_interface.py`)


The main interface defining the unified agent standard for Isabelle/HOL theorem proving.
#### Key Classes



**ProofContext**
- Represents the current state of an Isabelle proof
- Contains subgoals, priorities, proof depth, and resolution status
- Supports multi-objective priorities and Isabelle-specific features
- Key properties:
  - `active_goal_id`: Returns highest priority unsolved goal
  - `is_complete`: Checks if proof is complete
  - `num_subgoals`: Number of remaining subgoals
  - `progress_ratio`: Ratio of successful tactics

**ProofResult**
- Encapsulates the outcome and metrics of a proof attempt
- Contains success status, duration, proof steps, and final state
- Includes guidance calls and tactic recommendations for analysis

**IsabelleAgent (Abstract Base Class)**
- Defines the standard interface for all theorem proving agents
- Abstract methods:
  - `recommend_tactic()`: Generate next tactic for specified goal
  - `evaluate_priorities()`: Return priority scores for subgoals
- Concrete methods:
  - `prove_theorem()`: Main theorem proving method
  - `reset_session()`: Reset agent state between proofs


### 2. MCTS Agent (`gym/mcts_agent.py`)

Monte Carlo Tree Search interface implementation for theorem proving.


**MCTSProofContext**
- Extends `ProofContext` with MCTS-specific attributes
- Includes visit count, total value, children nodes, and parent references
- Supports tree search statistics and exhaustion tracking

**MCTSIsabelleAgent (Abstract Base Class)**
- Base class for MCTS theorem proving agents
- Abstract methods:
  - `estimate()`: Estimate state value
  - `select()`: Select search path from root to leaf
- Concrete methods:
  - `backup()`: Backpropagate value updates
  - `prove_theorem()`: Main MCTS search loop

**SimpleMCTSIsabelleAgent**
- Concrete implementation of MCTS agent
- Features:
  - Random value estimation for leaf nodes
  - UCB1 selection algorithm with exploration-exploitation balance
  - Content-based tactic selection strategy
  - Goal-specific tactic collections (primary, secondary, specialized)

### 3. Training Data System (`gym/training_data_system.py`)

Comprehensive system for collecting and managing training data from proof sessions.

#### Key Classes

**TacticInvocation**
- Records complete information for each tactic call
- Contains before/after states, tactic, success status, and execution metrics
- Includes used constants extraction and proof context
- Provides ML training format conversion

**ProofSession**
- Records complete proof session data
- Tracks theorem statement, agent name, duration, and success rate
- Contains all tactic invocations and session statistics
- Generates session summaries for analysis

**ConstantExtractor**
- Extracts mathematical constants and symbols from Isabelle tactics
- Identifies theorem references, mathematical constants, type constructors, and function names
- Filters Isabelle keywords and provides clean constant lists

**TrainingDataCollector**
- Main data collection interface
- Methods:
  - `start_session()`: Begin new proof session
  - `record_tactic_invocation()`: Record individual tactic calls
  - `end_session()`: Complete session and save data
  - `get_training_dataset()`: Retrieve filtered training data
  - `export_for_ml_training()`: Export data in ML formats (JSONL, CSV)
  - `generate_report()`: Generate collection statistics

**TrainingDataAgent**
- Wrapper agent that automatically collects training data
- Transparently wraps base agent methods
- Intercepts all tactic calls for data collection

#### Data Export Formats

- **JSONL**: Complete training records with input/target/metadata structure
- **CSV**: Simplified format for basic analysis
- **JSON**: Full session data with detailed statistics

### 4. Proof Visualizer (`gym/proof_visualizer.py`)

Interactive proof state visualization and session management.

#### Key Classes

**TacticResult**
- Enumeration for tactic execution results
- Values: `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `PARTIAL`, `PENDING`

**TacticExecution**
- Records single tactic execution with timestamps
- Tracks before/after subgoals and execution metrics
- Provides progress detection and change analysis

**ProofSession**
- Manages complete proof session visualization
- Tracks executions, success rates, and duration
- Provides session summaries and statistics

**ProofVisualizer**
- Main visualization interface
- Features:
  - Session management with start/end tracking
  - Real-time tactic execution display
  - Current proof state visualization
  - Tactics history with progress indicators
  - Session summary generation
  - Data export to JSON format
