# IsabelleGym Agent System

A comprehensive agent interface system for Isabelle/HOL theorem proving with integrated support for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), reinforcement learning, and training data collection. The project is based on unpublished work by Milan Tom from the University of Cambridge, and updated by Zijing Li from the University of Edinburgh.

##

This is a working branch by Xuanwei Ren from the University of Edinburgh on improving previous version of IsabelleGym.

## Overview

This system provides a unified interface for developing and deploying theorem proving agents in the IsabelleGym environment. It features multi-session support, training data collection, proof visualization, and seamless integration with various proving strategies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- JVM 17+
- Isabelle/HOL system
- IsabelleGym environment
- Optional: Visualization dependencies for enhanced display

```
The original IsabelleGym project which is the foundation of this project can be found from IsabelleGym.zip, also with the thesis.

## Deployment
### 1. Use install.sh
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh

### 2. Use Docker Compose

docker-compose up -d

source .venv/bin/activate

If meeting "Bad component..." problem when compiling scala backend, try creating a empty main file under isabelle/Admin/components path.
## Detailed Information

**TrainingDataAgent**
- Wrapper agent that automatically collects training data
- Transparently wraps base agent methods

### 4. Proof Visualizer (`gym/proof_visualizer.py`)

Interactive proof state visualization and session management.

#### Key Classes

**TacticResult**
- Enumeration for tactic execution results
- Values: `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `PARTIAL`, `PENDING`

**TacticExecution**
- Records single tactic execution with timestamps

## Performance Benchmark

Due to the nature of the session-based design of IsabelleGym, the performance benchmark is separated into two parts: proving performance, to measure the cpu time used for process; loading performance, to measure the average loading time of a single session.

### Process Benchmark
The previous work only provided benchmark for process time on selected theories from Archieve of Formal Proves (AFP).

These benchmarks are ran in docker on a Macbook Air with Apple M2 chip with resources of 8 CPUs and 12GB memory. **All benchmarks are average of three independent tests. All figures are rounded up to cloest integer.** _If CPU overheating or Out Of Memory (OOM) problem occours, the figure can double or triple._

| Theory             | Effective Lines | Average Process Time (s) |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| FOL_Harrison       | 2869            | 77                       |
| Finite_Map_Extras  | 650             | 16                       |
| Finite_Automata_HF | 1116            | 18                       |

### Loading Benchmark
In the last iteration of IsabelleGym, LRU cache was implemented. In this benchmark, we put the CPU time of a single generation of IsabelleGym session and the generation of three sessions through: independent generation, simple session pool and LRU cache.

| Theory                  | Sessions   | Process Time (s) | Average Time per session (s) |
| ------------------------| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Single generation       | 1          | 58               | 58                           |
| Independent generation  | 3          | 185              | 62                           |
| Simple Session Pool     | 3          | 60               | 20                           |
| LRU Cache               | 3          | 60               | 20                           |

## Current issues
- Isabelle directory for docker is overwrote by Mount
  - Solved, redirected isabelle dir
- Close & cleanup procedure crashed.
  - Solved, but error message from Isabelle itself cannot be removed.
- LRU efficiency benchmark script does not exist.
  - Solved, created and benchmark recorded
- AFP components not added
  - In progress, creating afp init script
- Due to missing component, process benchmark is not recreated
  - In progress
- Sledgehammer function missing
  - Unsolved
- Repl Backend does not support other imports
  - Unsolved, need to refine repo backend create functions
- This guy wrote a circular import, how?
  - Unsolved

### New design, workflow from install to use
1. Run docker/install.sh
  - Has isabelle, pip ready
2. Download afp, add afp via afp_init.py
  - Has afp as component ready
3. Start server/gym, double option avaliable

### Server idea
1. Server start with 1 default HOL.Main sessions in session pool
2. Server has shared local import memory for .thy artifacts
3. Server take new request from clients with header: theory name, imports, strategy
  - Strategies includes: single session, multi-collaberate, multi-competitive

## Priority
- Session thy
- Server side whole proof verification
- Implement and documentation
- Bugs above
- Scala level optimisation on isabelle heap sharing
