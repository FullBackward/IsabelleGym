"""Regression tests for ThreadedBackend shutdown semantics.

Guards against the e6c3869 regression where close() set _shutting_down and then
called self.submit(self._backend.exit) — which the guard itself rejected, so the
exit job never reached the JVM and every closed session leaked its poly process
and in-JVM Isabelle server (see claude-work/research-session-memory-release/).
