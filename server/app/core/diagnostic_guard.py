"""Regex gatekeeping for the diagnostic-command passthrough endpoint.

`POST /sessions/{id}/diagnostic` runs an ARBITRARY Isar command transiently
(insert edit -> read its writeln/state output -> discard the edit). Because the
string is processed by the prover, we must refuse anything that could execute
code, touch the filesystem, or smuggle a second (non-diagnostic) command past
the transient contract. Two layers:

  1. Allowlist (positive): the LEADING command keyword must be a known read-only
     diagnostic -- the ``print_*`` / ``find_*`` families (Isabelle's naming
     convention for ``Toplevel.keep`` inspectors) plus an explicit set of
     non-prefixed ones (``thm``, ``term``, ``prop``, ``typ``, ``prf``, ...).
  2. Denylist (defense in depth): NO ML-evaluating / IO / setup keyword may
     appear anywhere as a standalone token. This blocks ``thm foo\\nML ‹...›``
     style injection where a second command would still execute BEFORE the edit
     is discarded -- the only genuine code-execution risk left once the first
     keyword is allowlisted.

Both sets live here so a new Isabelle version / new diagnostic is a one-line
edit. ``validate_diagnostic_command`` raises ``ValueError`` on rejection; the
Pydantic request model surfaces that as HTTP 422.

Trade-off: the denylist is intentionally conservative and token-based, so a
legitimate but unusual query such as ``find_theorems name: ML`` is also refused.
Safety is preferred over that rare convenience; loosen the denylist here if it
proves too aggressive.
