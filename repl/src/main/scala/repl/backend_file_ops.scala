/** LSP-like file-sync surface of [[ReplBackend]]: load a chunk (typically a
 *  whole document) and report per-command status WITHOUT rolling back ordinary
 *  failures — the broken state stays in the node so the caller can inspect and
 *  fix it (the dual of `verify_chunk`'s transactional semantics). Consumed via
 *  PUT /api/v1/sessions/{id}/document with report=true — the file-sync
 *  primitive of the planned LSP-like read-only MCP.
 *
 *  Also hosts the INCREMENTAL file-sync primitive `sync_document` (Phase B1):
 *  a spliff-diffed PIDE replace edit against the live node, so re-syncs after
 *  small agent edits re-process only the changed tail instead of resetting
 *  and re-elaborating the whole file (see its Scaladoc for the fallback
 *  contract and the divergent timeout semantics).
 *
 *  Also hosts the LSP-like READ-ONLY line queries (`command_at_line`,
 *  `goals_at_line`): snapshot-based, no edits and no ML probes, so they work at
 *  any document position — including past a trailing theory `end`, where the
 *  channel probes of Backend_Probes would hang.
 *
 *  Semantics: on BUDGET TIMEOUT the chunk IS discarded (to cancel a runaway
 *  command); on ordinary failure it is kept. The `probe_state` flag controls
 *  whether proof_open/pending_qed are probed — callers pass false when the
 *  text ends with theory `end`, where a trailing probe would never execute. */

   * Load a chunk and report per-command status, WITHOUT rollback on ordinary
   * failure (LSP-style: broken state stays in the node so the caller can
   * inspect and fix it — the dual of verify_chunk's transactional semantics).
   * Returns the same JSON per-command report shape as verify_chunk.
   * Used by the LSP-like file-sync mode via load_document
   * (PUT /api/v1/sessions/{id}/document with report=true).
   *
   * Two caveats:
   *  - On BUDGET TIMEOUT the chunk IS discarded (discard_last_edit) to cancel
   *    the runaway command — leaving a looping `metis` churning is never what a
   *    caller wants. The report's `timed_out`/`running` line names the loop.
   *  - `proof_open`/`pending_qed` are only probed when the chunk succeeded AND
   *    `probe_state` is true. Callers pass probe_state=false when the text ends
   *    with theory `end`: a probe appended past `end` never executes, so the
   *    ML channel would hang until timeout. On failure both are false (the
   *    caller inspects `commands[]` instead).
   *  - When the kept chunk leaves the document ending with theory `end`, both
   *    are hardcoded false WITHOUT probing: a successful `end` means no proof
   *    is open (and probing past `end` would hang). The `probe_state` flag is
   *    kept as belt-and-braces for reports generated differently.

  /** INCREMENTAL counterpart of step_chunk_report (Phase B1): diff `text`

   *  instead of the caller resetting and re-elaborating from line 1.
   *
   *  Returns the same JSON per-command report shape as step_chunk_report, with
   *  two contract additions:
   *   - `"line_semantics": "absolute"` — command `line` fields are ABSOLUTE
   *     node lines (the replace diff has no contiguous chunk to relativize
   *     against), and the report covers only the re-processed tail (commands
   *     starting at/after first_changed_line - 1).
   *   - `"fallback": "no_begun_theory" | "header_changed"` INSTEAD of a report
   *     when no incremental edit may be attempted (no begun theory, or the
   *     first diff hunk touches the `theory … begin` span — includes a
   *     theory-name change). The caller MUST fall back to the reset path.
   *
   *  TIMEOUT SEMANTICS differ from step_chunk_report ON PURPOSE: on budget
   *  expiry the replace edit is NOT discarded — a replace is an interleaved
   *  insert/remove sequence with no single insert to discard, unlike the
   *  append-only chunk step_chunk_report can drop via discard_last_edit. The
   *  report carries timed_out=true and the partial state stays for inspection
